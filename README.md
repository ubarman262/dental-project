## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ubarman262/dental-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd dental-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Here's an example `.env` file:

   ```
   PORT=3001

   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key_here (should be different from access token secret)
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=3600
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=86400

   DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@host:port/defaultdb?sslmode=require"
   REDIS_URL="rediss://username:password@host:port"

   S3_ENDPOINT='https://<S3_BUCKET_ENDPOINT>'
   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   S3_BASE_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME>

   ```

Replace `your_secret_key_here`, `your_firebase_project_id`, `your_firebase_client_email`, `your_firebase_private_key`, `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `defaultdb` with your actual values.

5. Start the development server:

```

npm run dev

```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web portal.
